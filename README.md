# 3X3-Matrix-Inverse
This Android application has been created in order to allow students to quickly verify the inversion of their matrices. In this new-master branch , a seperate project
to convert the application into a (2x2, 3x3 and 4x4) matrix converter is taking place, in theory making the application a Matrix Inverter rather than a 3x3 Matrix Inverter.
